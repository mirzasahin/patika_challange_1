## This project is the first challange of the **Patika Frontend Web Development**.

 In this challenge, a user name was taken with a **prompt** and assigned to a variable, then displayed with the current time in the *HTML* interface using the **querySelector** feature.
 
 With *JavaScript* function was created and **if-else parameters** were used.
 
 This project is the first project I uploaded to githup. In this process, I learned how to use *git and githup*.
